# Medieval 2 Optimal Troops Recruitment

When not reading about finance or poker I like to play Medieval 2 (probably one of the best strategic games ever created).

In the game you need to make lots of decisions and it would be great if they were all optimal. 
The aim of this project is to optimize the decision process related to the trrops recruitment. 
Given an initial capital the program will tell you how many and which units to buy in order to maximize attack and defense.
This is a constraint optimization problem as we cannot recruit more troops than we can afford (and we must also consider the upkeep).
